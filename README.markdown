# ackfock

A hosting platform for tiny memos of understanding (MOUs).
It was a startup project. Now open source.


## Code
### Front-end and Back-end
All written in or generated by Common Lisp code.
It's too painful to create today's web apps in Common Lisp. If you want, I suggest you do so only in back-end, even if it is a big issue about the hosting on cloud providers.

### Database
Written in PostgreSQL.

## Demo
